* Finish the Wiki basic data accessors (load, store, exists) for
  StorageFile and StorageSqlite3

* Once we know where the data is stored, we have to know data format to
  read/write and get the internal memory structure Parser
  (ParserTxt2tag, ParselWakka, ParserXML, etc.)

* Clean up accessors as storage_dependant modules (WikiStorageFile,
  WikiStorageSqlite, etc.).

* Create a generic Gui (GuiGtk, GuiWeb, etc.)
